# =============================================================================
# Release Workflow - Automated versioning with Changesets
# =============================================================================
# This workflow runs every time you push to main. It does TWO things:
#
# MODE 1: Create Release PR (when changesets exist)
#   - If you've added changesets (via "npm run changeset"), this workflow
#     creates a "Release PR" that shows:
#     * What version bump will happen (patch/minor/major)
#     * The updated CHANGELOG.md
#   - The Release PR stays open until you're ready to release
#
# MODE 2: Publish Release (when Release PR is merged)
#   - When you merge the Release PR, this workflow:
#     * Updates package.json version
#     * Updates CHANGELOG.md
#     * Creates a git tag (e.g., v0.2.0)
#     * Creates a GitHub Release
#
# This gives YOU control over WHEN to release, while automating the HOW!
