# =============================================================================
# CI Workflow - Runs on every Pull Request to main
# =============================================================================
# This workflow automatically checks your code quality when you open a PR.
# It runs two checks:
#   1. Lint - Checks for code style issues and potential bugs
#   2. Build - Verifies the project compiles successfully
#
# If either check fails, you'll see a red X on your PR.
# Fix the issues before merging!

    name: Lint and Build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Download your code from the repository
      # This is like doing "git clone" on the CI server
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Install Node.js on the CI server
      # We use Node 20 (LTS) for stability
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"

      # Step 3: Install all project dependencies
      # "npm ci" is like "npm install" but faster and stricter for CI
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Run the linter to check code quality
      # This catches style issues and potential bugs early
      - name: Run linter
        run: npm run lint

      # Step 5: Build the project to verify it compiles
      # This catches TypeScript errors and build configuration issues
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build
